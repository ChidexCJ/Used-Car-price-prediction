# Used-Car-price-prediction
This is a Machine learning project whose goal is to develop a model that could predict the price of different used cars.
For the purpose of Visualization in Exploratory Data Analysis, Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries of python language were used.
Feature engineering techniques applied includes Outlier management, One-Hot-Encoding and Normalization(StandardScaler).
Two models were created using Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms.
These models yielded different results on the evaluation metrics with Random Forest yielding the best outcome for each metric considered with an R2_score of 95%, Mean Absolute error of 1963 and a Mean Squared Error score of 3083.
IDE used is Jupyter Notebook.
Dataset was sourced from kaggle.com
